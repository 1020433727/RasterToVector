DIRECTORY
 - src - Contains source files
 - res - Contains sample images
 - out - The default directory to save the exported images

APPLICATION
 - Contained in toVector.m, and toVector.fig
 - Open
   - The Open button creates a file dialog to select which image to open.
 - Export to SVG
   - The Export button invokes the toSVG script with the current model.
 - Vectorize
   - Invokes the toVector function.
 - Find Lines
   - Launch the linesGUI with the open image.
 - Reset
   - Reset the state of the GUI.
 - Mode
   - Set the type of vector conversion to preform
     - Polygons
     - Beziergons
 - Parmeters
   - Num of Colors - The number of colors to simplify the image to.
   - % Verticies to keep - The precentage of verticies to keep during the vectorization process.
   - Max Square Error - The max square error to be used during vectorization.

VECTORIZATION
 - Contained in toVector.m
 - The GUI will pause between steps if the 
 - A popup will apear after completion

LINES
 - The linesGUI.m file contains the implementation of Hough line detection
 - This was kept separate from the vectorization implmentation as it produced disapointing results
 - The GUI lets the user modify the parameters used in the line detection process
   - The Gap Fill parameter sets the max gap disstance to fill
   - The Min Length parameter sets the minimum length of line to keep
 - The showsteps checkbox sets weather to show intermediate steps in the line detection process

EXPORT
 - The export method opens a file dialog to allow the user to specify the path and filename.
 - Once the export is complete the file is opened for editing by matlab.
